Special tests for super errors (the pretty error display)

Run `node ./jscomp/build_tests/super_errors/input.js` to check the tests against previous snapshots.
Run `node ./jscomp/build_tests/super_errors/input.js update` to update the snapshots (assuming you've made some changes to super errors' display and/or messages)
