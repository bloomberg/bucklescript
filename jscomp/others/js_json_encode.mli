(** Provides functions for encoding a JSON data structure *)

external null : Js.json = "" [@@bs.val]
(** [null] is the singleton null JSON value *)

external string : string -> Js.json = "%identity"
(** [string s] makes a JSON string of the [string] [s] *)

external float : float -> Js.json = "%identity"
(** [float n] makes a JSON number of the [float] [n] *)

external int : int -> Js.json = "%identity"
(** [int n] makes a JSON number of the [int] [n] *)

external boolean : Js.boolean -> Js.json = "%identity" 
(** [boolean b] makes a JSON boolean of the [Js.boolean] [b] *)

external object_ : Js.json Js_dict.t -> Js.json = "%identity"
(** [object_ dict] makes a JSON objet of the [Js.Dict.t] [dict] *)

external array_ : Js.json array -> Js.json = "%identity"
(** [array_ a] makes a JSON array of the [Js.Json.t array] [a] *)

(** The functions below are specialized for specific array type which 
    happened to be already JSON object in the BuckleScript runtime. Therefore
    they are more efficient (constant time rather than linear conversion). *) 

external stringArray : string array -> Js.json = "%identity"
(** [stringArray a] makes a JSON array of the [string array] [a] *) 

external numberArray : float array -> Js.json = "%identity"
(** [numberArray a] makes a JSON array of the [float array] [a] *)

external booleanArray : Js.boolean array -> Js.json = "%identity"
(** [booleanArray] makes a JSON array of the [Js.boolean array] [a] *)

external objectArray : Js.json Js_dict.t array -> Js.json = "%identity"
(** [objectArray a] makes a JSON array of the [JsDict.t array] [a] *)
